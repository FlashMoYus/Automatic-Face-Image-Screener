# Automatic-Face-Image-Screener
## Why we need this?
Face images are in need, especially good images. It takes time to select manually. Therefore, we need an automatic one.
## What is the goal?
It should have the ability to evaluate an image from its clartiy, brightness, contrast as well as the face's position and deflection. Based on the evaluation, keep only the good-quality ones on the storage.
## How to achieve this?
### Clarity
......
### Brightness & Contrast
......(I am tired)
## The progress...?
Clarity, brightness and contrast have been implemented. The improvement for the model for the latter two is in progress. Maybe more complex methods should be introduced. The method for deflection and position is still offline.
